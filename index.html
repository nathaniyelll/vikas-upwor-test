        Bike insurance, also known as two-wheeler insurance, is an agreement
        between the bike owner and the insurance provider, wherein the insurer
        commits to provide financial compensation for any damages incurred by
        the insured two-wheeler. It basically is a protection against unforeseen
        circumstances including thefts, collisions, or accidents. There are
        three types of bike insurance policies that you can choose from,
        third-party, comprehensive, and standalone own-damage bike insurance. A
        third-party bike insurance is a must-have according to the Motor
        Vehicles Act of 1988.

            A comprehensive two-wheeler policy gives complete coverage by paying
            your financial liabilities that you may incur towards a third party
            and by providing compensation for expenses arising due to
            own-damages sustained by your bike. This policy shields your bike
            against damages it sustains due to an accident, fire, theft,
            man-made disasters, natural calamities, self-ignition, explosion,
            and so on. You can also enhance its coverage by paying an additional
            premium to purchase add-on covers like zero depreciation cover,
            roadside assistance cover, engine cover, etc.

            In India, a third-party two-wheeler insurance plan is a compulsory
            requirement to ride a bike. It is also known as liability-only
            policy which covers bodily injuries, temporary or permanent
            disability, and death of the third party person due to an accident
            or a mishap with the involvement of the insured’s bike. This
            motorcycle or scooter insurance policy also covers the property
            damage expenses sustained by the third party up to Rs. 1 Lakh, but
            does not cover damages incurred by the insured’s bike or the insured
            person.

            The standalone own-damage two-wheeler insurance policy gives
            coverage for the own-damages sustained by the insured bike due to an
            accident, theft, fire, natural disaster and man-made calamity. A
            standalone own-damage policy provides flexibility to policyholders
            for choosing an insurance company of their choice. The policyholders
            can buy a third-party policy and own-damage policy either from the
            same insurer or a different one. An insured individual can expand
            the coverage of a own-damage insurance policy by buying add-on
            covers.
