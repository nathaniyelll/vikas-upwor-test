        Bike insurance, also known as two-wheeler insurance, is an agreement
        between the bike owner and the insurance provider, wherein the insurer
        commits to provide financial compensation for any damages incurred by
        the insured two-wheeler. It basically is a protection against unforeseen
        circumstances including thefts, collisions, or accidents. There are
        three types of bike insurance policies that you can choose from,
        third-party, comprehensive, and standalone own-damage bike insurance. A
        third-party bike insurance is a must-have according to the Motor
        Vehicles Act of 1988.

          A comprehensive car insurance policy is the most extensive insurance cover under which an insurance company is liable to pay for financial liabilities incurred towards a third-party as well as for the own-damages sustained by the insured’s car. In addition to road accidents, the policy is applicable in the event of natural calamities, man-made disasters, self-ignition or lightning, explosion, fire, theft, etc

          Third-party car insurance policy is a mandatory requirement for driving a car in India. It is the most basic insurance plan and is thus also called Liability Only Car Insurance Policy. Under this cover, the insurance company is liable to pay for the bodily injuries, permanent disability, temporary disability as well as death of the third party caused by an accident involving the insured’s car. This plan also provides coverage for property damage incurred by the third party up to Rs. 7.5 Lakh.

          In September 2019, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) introduced the Standalone Own-Damage car insurance policy. Under this plan, the insured gets insurance coverage only for the own-damages sustained by his/her four-wheeler in a road accident, natural/man-made calamity, fire, explosion, theft or any other mishap. A standalone own-damage car insurance policy aims at offering the insured the flexibility in terms of the insurance provider they want to choose.
