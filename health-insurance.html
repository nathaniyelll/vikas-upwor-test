        Medical inflation is on a rise. Lifestyle diseases are increasing too. Getting hospitalized on an emergency basis without having health cover can exhaust your savings in no time. Buying a mediclaim policy can provide you with the required financial assistance in case of hospitalization. The policy provides coverage against medical expenses that you may incur during the policy period. With a valid mediclaim, you can also receive tax benefits under section 80D of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

Health insurance is an agreement between the insurer and the policyholder whereby an insurance company agrees to reimburse for medical costs incurred by the policyholder during the tenure of the policy. According to the policy terms, the insured may incur medical expenses if they get ill or meet an unfortunate accident that leads to treatment at the hospital. To avail of the coverage benefits of health insurance policy, the policyholder must pay a specific amount periodically, called a premium. The premium is determined by the insurance company and must be paid by the policyholders without any fail either monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually.

                    <li><span class="fw-bold" style="color: #7A7A7A;">Check the Different Car Insurance Types</span>: With three different types of four wheeler insurance available, it is crucial to assess your car insurance needs and accordingly finalise the type of policy you need.

                        <span class="fw-bold" style="color: #7A7A7A;">Check for IDV</span>: IDV or the Insured Declared Value refers to the current market value of your car. As your vehicle suffers wear and tear, then the value of your car decreases. It is the maximum amount that your insurance company will settle in case your car is completely damaged or stolen. The car insurance premium is directly proportional to the IDV, which means that the higher the IDV, the higher will be the four wheeler insurance premium.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="fw-bold" style="color: #7A7A7A;">Compare Different Plans</span>: You should compare different car insurance plans online.

                    <li>
                        <span class="fw-bold" style="color: #7A7A7A;"> Check Claim Settlement Ratio</span>: The claim Settlement Ratio in four wheeler insurance refers to the efficiency of car insurance companies in getting their car insurance claims settled. It thus refers to the percentage of claims settled by the insurer in a year. So, always look for an insurance company that has a simple and swift claim process and check their Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR) before finalising. It is better to buy a plan from a company with high CSR.

                    <li>
                        <span class="fw-bold" style="color: #7A7A7A;">Services Offered</span>: In addition to the claim settlement ratio, you should also check the services offered by your four wheeler insurance company. For instance, you must understand whether the company offers a quick claim settlement, 24*7 service, and other services. You should thus choose a company that offers hassle-free customer service.
