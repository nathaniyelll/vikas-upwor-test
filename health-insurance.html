According to the policy terms, the insured may incur medical expenses if they get ill or meet an unfortunate accident that leads to treatment at the hospital. To avail of the coverage benefits of health insurance policy, the policyholder must pay a specific amount periodically, called a premium. The premium is determined by the insurance company and must be paid by the policyholders without any fail either monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually.
